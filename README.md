# Real Estate Price Prediction

This project showcases a real estate price prediction website that predicts home prices in Bangalore. Starting with the creation of a predictive model using scikit-learn and linear regression, leveraging the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle, the project progresses to developing a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests and deploying a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Key Highlights:**

**Data Science Concepts:** Data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and k-fold cross-validation.


**Technologies and Tools:** Utilizes Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, scikit-learn for model development, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs, Python Flask for the HTTP server, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface.

First, run the server.py file. Once the file is running, open the HTML file and try out different prediction scenarios.
